This is a basic Readme for the my current collection of SIMC mc and XEMC cross section

This contains 3 main dirs.
-phase_space_fall16 
--- This contains the useful and most up todate version of Hall A HRS transport monte carlo. That I know of approx - Summer 2017

-weight_C12_Ar
---This contains some simple scripts to take a cross section table and do some basic interpolation to weight an event produced from the monte carlo
	for run from the single arm C12 Argon data. 

-XEMC
---This contians Zihungs XEMC cross section model. Still working on it.
